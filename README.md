Data Visualization Tools refer to all forms of software designed to visualize data. Different tools can contain varying features but, at their most basic, data visualization tools will provide you with the capabilities to input datasets and visually manipulate them.
 
PowerBI is the interactive and productive data visualization application developed by Microsoft PowerBI which most primarly relies on Business Intelligence.
 
In this visualization, I have developed an dashboard which analyses the integrity , performance and the activities that was running in the sales department using PowerBI . It comprises of more than multiple dashboards in which the data is routed and linked with the visualization dhasboards and also it depends on changing the data period at initial dashboard to final dashboard. This visualization project dashboard has been deployed in the public visualization environment.

I have uploaded the business intelligence project in the form of pdf file format as I have extracted from powerBI user dashboard for in the case of ease of viewing and analyzing. It is available as the deployment version in PowerBI public mode.

Microsoft PowerBI Visualization Steps to accomplish an complete dashboard:

 - Finding and integrating the right amount of data with null point labels or values.
 
 - Importing the data into the PowerBI environment.
 
 - Analysing the type of data and ensuring that every labels and values are filled with the right data.
 
 - Confirming the data to be used in the report.
